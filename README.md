# Synesthesia
 A sensitive experience in a 3D VR world!

## Description
Synesthesia is a little experiment of 3D and virtual reality code that questions the link between objects and focuses on senses in a VR environment. It is a visual zone where the player can paint and draw with moving color palettes.

### Color
The white color in the middle of the palette is a kind of reset to allows the player to wipe off the color and its sound, restart a new work, again and again.

### Sound
To add a synesthetic dimension, every color is associated to a sound. The sound volume depends on the position of the player and changes with their movements. In that sense, the player is creating simultaneously a visual and auditive piece of pixel art. 

### Space
To move within the space, the player needs to use the arrows on the keyboard.

The white cube into which the player is is made out of six matrixes that can be used as painting canvas, from the inside as much as from the outside of the cube. 

Every face of the cube can be used to express creativity and to try to mix visual and auditive dimensions to create something unique.
